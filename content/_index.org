* hugorc - A sane web anti-framework port to hugo

hugorc is a simple and minimalistic theme for the hugo static CMS generator
based on the werc antiframework.

hugorc makes easy theme management, and publishing a very big amount of content
very easily. In the [[/development][development]] section you will find a step by step guide on
how to setup this theme in your new - or already existing - hugo websites, how
to modify it, add content, manage themes and even writing your own.

I really hope you like this, and don't forget to check [[http://werc.cat-v.org/][werc]] from cat-v as well.
